# CS236299: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

The course is currently in progress, and the repository will be fully uploaded upon its completion.

## Course Info
Introduction to natural language processing. The course presents methods for
representing human language at different levels, moving from simple bag-of-words
representations, through sequential models, to syntactic and semantic structures. At each
level, the course develops several machine learning models and algorithms for solving
various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, sequence labeling,
syntactic parsing, and semantic parsing. The course discusses models such as Na√Øve
Bayes, logistic regression, hidden Markov models, various deep neural networks, and
appropriate learning algorithms for estimating their parameters. The course emphasizes
implementation of classical and modern natural language processing models.


## Learning outcomes:
By the end of this course, the student will be able to:
1. Model the standard levels of linguistic structures using formal grammars or
statistical and computational models.
2. Identify and carry out proper experimental methodology for training and
evaluating natural language processing systems.
3. Manipulate probabilities and estimate parameters of structured models using
supervised training methods.
4. Implement simple models of language, and employ and adapt them in service of
solving natural language processing problems.
